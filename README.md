# Bigram Language Model (PyTorch)

A simple implementation of a **Bigram Language Model** built using PyTorch. This project demonstrates how language models work at the most fundamental level, using only token embeddings and bigram probabilities to generate text. It is a great starting point for anyone learning **NLP** and **PyTorch**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Implements a basic **Bigram Language Model** from scratch.
- Uses **PyTorch Embeddings** to represent tokens.
- Includes **forward propagation** and **cross-entropy loss** for training.
- Generates text sequences based on learned bigram probabilities.
- Clean and minimal code, ideal for **learning NLP basics**.
